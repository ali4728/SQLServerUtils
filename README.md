# SQLServerUtils
Browse and Search SQL Server Ojbects in local web UI - Original project was forked from https://github.com/usharik/MsSqlDependencyBrowser. It was written in Angular js and I replaced it with Vue.js and bunch of C# logic to fit my needs.

The project has two seperate parts!
### C# console application used as a simple webapp served at localhose:8084
### Vue js web application used to develop index.html and javascript components.
### A powershell script (in Utils folder) is used to copy vue compiled js into c# console app
